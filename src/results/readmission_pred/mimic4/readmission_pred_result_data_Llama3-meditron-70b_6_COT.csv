The authors report a case of a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a 2-month history of progressive dyspnea and cough. Chest radiography showed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. The patient was treated with antibiotics and steroids without improvement. A transbronchial biopsy was performed and the histological examination showed a diffuse alveolar damage. The patient died 2 months after the onset of symptoms. The autopsy revealed a diffuse alveolar damage with a marked fibroblastic proliferation. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was made. The authors discuss the clinical, radiological and pathological features of this disease. .

The authors report a case of a 45-year-old man with a history of alcohol abuse who presented with a 2-month history of progressive dyspnea and cough. Chest radiography showed bilateral diffuse interstitial infiltrates. The patient was treated with antibiotics and steroids without improvement. A transbronchial biopsy was performed and the histological examination showed a diffuse alveolar damage. The patient died 2 months after the onset of symptoms. The autopsy revealed a diffuse alveolar damage with a marked fibroblastic proliferation. The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis was made. The authors discuss the clinical, radiological and pathological features of this disease. .
