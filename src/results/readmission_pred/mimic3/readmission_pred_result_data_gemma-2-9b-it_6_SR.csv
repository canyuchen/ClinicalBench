It's impossible to say for certain whether a patient will be readmitted to the hospital based solely on their medical history and current medications. While the patient has a complex medical history with multiple chronic conditions, the procedure they underwent (replacement of automatic cardioverter/defibrillator lead(s) only) is relatively common and generally has a low risk of complications. 

However, the patient's age, multiple comorbidities, and use of various medications, including those for heart failure and arrhythmias, increase their overall risk of readmission. 

Ultimately, a more comprehensive assessment considering factors like post-operative recovery, adherence to medication regimen, and access to follow-up care is needed to make a more accurate prediction.
