Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively predict whether the patient will die or not. However, given the seriousness of the patient's conditions and the aggressive treatment being received, it is important to monitor the patient closely and provide appropriate supportive care.

Therefore, the answer is 1 if the patient will die and 0 otherwise. It is important to note that this prediction is based on the information provided and may not be accurate in all cases. Medical professionals should always consider the individual patient's specific circumstances and make decisions based on their clinical judgment.

2. Consider the patient's medical history: The patient has a history of major depressive affective disorder, recurrent episode, severe, without mention of psychotic behavior. This suggests a predisposition to mental health issues and potential self-harm.

3. Evaluate the patient's other conditions: The patient has rhabdomyolysis, a precipitous drop in hematocrit, and poisoning by other opiates and related narcotics, aromatic analgesics, and uric acid metabolism drugs. These conditions can further complicate the patient's overall health and increase the risk of death.

4. Consider the patient's procedures and drug use: The patient has undergone arthrocentesis and is using various drugs, including i.v. solution additives, vitamin B1, dopaminergic agents, anxiolytics, antithrombotic agents, opioids, muscle relaxants, centrally acting agents, antiarrhythmics, nasal decongestants, analgesics, antipruritics, anesthetics, antiinflammatory and antirheumatic products, antiemetics, antidepressants, diuretics, and thiazides. These medications can have potential side effects and interactions that may contribute to the patient's overall health status.

5. Analyze the patient's risk factors: The patient has a history of suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by tranquilizers and other psychotropic agents, analgesics, antipyretics, and antirheumatics.

Assess the patient's condition: The patient is experiencing hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract, acute kidney failure, acute posthemorrhagic anemia, volume depletion, unspecified essential hypertension, leukocytosis, and is undergoing endoscopic control of gastric or duodenal bleeding, transfusion of packed cells, and gastric lavage.

2. Evaluate the severity of the conditions: The patient's conditions are serious and potentially life-threatening. Hemorrhage of the gastrointestinal tract can lead to significant blood loss, acute kidney failure can impair kidney function, and acute posthemorrhagic anemia can result in decreased oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood. Volume depletion can further exacerbate these conditions.

3. Consider the treatment options: The patient is undergoing endoscopic control of gastric or duodenal bleeding, transfusion of packed cells, and gastric lavage. These interventions aim to stop the bleeding, replenish blood volume, and remove any remaining blood or debris from the gastrointestinal tract.

4. Assess the patient's response to treatment: The patient's response to treatment will determine the outcome. If the bleeding is successfully controlled, blood volume is restored, and kidney function improves, the patient may recover. However, if the bleeding continues, blood volume cannot be adequately restored, or kidney function does not improve, the patient's condition may worsen and lead to death.
