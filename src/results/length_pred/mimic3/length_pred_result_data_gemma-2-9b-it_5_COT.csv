**Reasoning:**

1. **Severity of Conditions:** The patient presents with ventricular fibrillation, cardiomyopathy, and a history of cardiac arrest, indicating a serious cardiac condition.
2. **Complex Procedures:** The planned procedures include AICD implantation, cardiac catheterization, and coronary angiography, all of which are invasive and require significant recovery time.
3. **Medication Complexity:** The patient is on a complex regimen of medications, including antiarrhythmics, beta-blockers, antithrombotics, and gastrointestinal medications, suggesting ongoing management needs.
4. **History of Noncompliance:** The patient's history of noncompliance with medical treatment raises concerns about adherence to post-discharge care and potential complications.
5. **Potential Complications:** Given the severity of the conditions and procedures, there is a risk of post-operative complications requiring extended hospital stay.

**Prediction:** 2 (more than one week but not more than two weeks) 


The patient's complex medical history, invasive procedures, and potential for complications suggest a hospital stay exceeding one week but likely within two weeks.
